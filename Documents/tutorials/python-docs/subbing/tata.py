# Problem 1 - Make a list with the letters a through g. Loop through them and 
# print them all out on the same line using a for loop.


letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g"]

for letter in letters:
    print letter,


# Problem 2 - Write a while loop that prompts the user to enter what year it is. 
#The loop will continue until they enter 2013. hint Remember things from 
#the user via raw_input are strings and cant be compared to numbers in a useful way.


#buhbuh = int(raw_input("What year is it?"))

#while buhbuh != 2013:
    #buhbuh = int(raw_input("What year is it?"))
    #print buhbuh

# Problem 3 - Write a new function called reverse_list. Have the function signature accept a variable called list_to_reverse. Inside the function make a new list and insert the contents of list_to_reverse in reverse order. Return the new list. Call the function with the list of letters above.
